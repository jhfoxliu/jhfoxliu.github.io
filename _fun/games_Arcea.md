[Arcaea](https://arcaea.fandom.com/wiki/Arcaea_Wiki) is a rythmic game for mobile devices.

It is amazing to play a rythmic game: you are trainig yourself like training a deep learning model; you might overfit while playing some challenging songs; you might be better in some songs if you leave your iPad for somedays - you have a forgetting mechanism! I guess playing rythmic games can also keep you away from senile dementia because you're training your brain. Join it?
