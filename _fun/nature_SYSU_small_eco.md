### May 2nd, 2022. Rainy.

A rain well in my way home.

    <div class="caption">
        There are some frogs trapped in the well. But they just went a way next day! Their name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_bullfrog"><i>Kaloula pulchra</i> (花狭口蛙)</a>. They have a big population in the college.

These frogs feel so comfortable in the rain. It was the right time for courtship, but they are too large to escape from the well. Some frogs are lucky to meet the one in their life, and some are not so lucky. Just along the road, the trapped forgs just sang loudly to communicate to each other. Pherhaps they are ultizing the well to amplify their songs?

At that night, I was just wondering if the population in a well was too large. There were so many eggs in a well! If all the eggs hatched, the well will get too crowded for the tapoles. My another concern was about the water. As the tide, the wells are not always filled with water. If it keeps sunny for days, the tadpoles will die of drought!

    Eggs and tadpoles!

But my concerns just disappeared in the next morning. When I came back to the well, the frogs, along with the eggs and tadpoles just went away. Maybe these wells are connected to the small lack not far away. Good luck, frogs!
