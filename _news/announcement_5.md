>##At What Age Do Male Cats Stop Reproducing
>
>Like female cats, male cats don’t ever stop reproducing, regardless of their age. Some male cats are infertile, although that has nothing to do with their age; it’s usually chalked up to genetics.
>
>Since male cats can continue to reproduce throughout their lives, it’s even more reason for neutering! Especially if you have a male outdoor cat, he’ll never outgrow his ability to sire a litter; this is a big part of the feline population problem.
