I love this simple experiemnt in my `Cell Biology` course, where we were assigned to design a cell biology experiment and finsih it in a group.

I was inspirated by [this PNAS paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1115323109) entitled "Experimental evolution of multicellularity". The idea is simple: we can use gravity to select yeast colonies in a culture. For each passage, we separate the cells from the top and the bottom of the centrifuged culture and inoculate them in new medium. After 21 days' culture we successfully obtain much more "multicellular" yeast in our experiemntal group (the ones in the bottom).
