### The miRNA editing database

The miRNA editing database (miREDB) was built with `Asp`, deployed on `Windows Sever`.

In this project, I learned a lot about `HTML`, `SQL`, `Java script`, `CSS`, and most importantly `how to consider the project from the view of user` <sub>, and especially how to prevent the user from destorying your sever</sub>. To be honest, the database was a bit slow in processing the inquires, <sub>because the codes writen were too heavy</sub>, but **it indeed can run**. No long after our paper published, we were forced to terminate our service as well as the lab home page deployed on the server, <sub>for the unlimited requirement of security from the bureaucrats</sub>.
