### In breif

- We profiled mRNA m5C landscapes in developmental stages of human, mouse, frogs, zebrafish, and fly.
- We found an unexpected strong enrichment of mRNA m5C in oocytes and early embryos.
- The enrichment of m5C quickly vanish as the development progress.
- The m5C sites are majorly contributed by NSUN2 and NSUN6.
- In fruit fly, the deficiency of NSUN2 can lead to a slight delay in development.
- The gain-and-loss of NSUN2-mediated sites can majorly come from cis-regulatory factors.
- The unique innovation of NSUN6-mediated sites in human oocyte can come from a trans-regulation.
