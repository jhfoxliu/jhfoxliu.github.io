Welcome to my website!

You can also call me [`Fox`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Mulder). 

I am a `full-stack` biology geek experienced in biotechnology and bioinformatics. My ambition is to build revolutionary paradigms to increase our understanding about the biological world. To achieve this, I would love to apply any available approaches. I also love creating beautiful [figures and illustrations](/gallery/), which can help us broadcast the fantastic findings. I am also writing some [tutorials](/tutorials/) on the website.

I was graduated from [Rui Zhang's Lab](http://lifesciences.sysu.edu.cn/teachersprofessor/300) @ Sun Yat-sen Univerisity and I am now moving to [Jaffrey's lab](https://jaffreylab.org/) for my postodc career. If you are interested in my stories, click [here](https://jhfoxliu.github.io/blog/category/story/). 

And [here](/assets/pdf/cv/liujh_cv.pdf) is my Curriculum Vitae. (not up-to-date)


[Besides work](/fun/), I love games, photograph, animations, and observing the nature.

I also love trying tasty foods and I love making them by myself (my hometown [Shunde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunde_District) is an amazing place for foods!).
