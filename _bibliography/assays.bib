  abstract={m5C is one of the longest-known RNA modifications, however, its developmental dynamics, functions, and evolution in mRNAs remain largely unknown. Here, we generate quantitative mRNA m5C maps at different stages of development in 6 vertebrate and invertebrate species and find convergent and unexpected massive methylation of maternal mRNAs mediated by NSUN2 and NSUN6. Using Drosophila as a model, we reveal that embryos lacking maternal mRNA m5C undergo cell cycle delays and fail to timely initiate maternal-to-zygotic transition, implying the functional importance of maternal mRNA m5C. From invertebrates to the lineage leading to humans, two waves of m5C regulatory innovations are observed: higher animals gain cis-directed NSUN2-mediated m5C sites at the 5' end of the mRNAs, accompanied by the emergence of more structured 5'UTR regions; humans gain thousands of trans-directed NSUN6-mediated m5C sites enriched in genes regulating the mitotic cell cycle. Collectively, our studies highlight the existence and regulatory innovations of a mechanism of early embryonic development and provide key resources for elucidating the role of mRNA m5C in biology and disease.},

  abstract={mRNA m5C, which has recently been implicated in the regulation of mRNA mobility, metabolism and translation, plays important regulatory roles in various biological events. Two types of m5C sites are found in mRNAs. Type I m5C sites, which contain a downstream G-rich triplet motif and are computationally predicted to be located at the 5' end of putative hairpin structures, are methylated by NSUN2. Type II m5C sites contain a downstream UCCA motif and are computationally predicted to be located in the loops of putative hairpin structures. However, their biogenesis remains unknown. Here we identified NSUN6, a methyltransferase that is known tomethylate C72 of tRNAThr and tRNA=Cys, as an mRNAmethyltransferase that targets Type II m5C sites. Combining the RNA secondary structure prediction, miCLIP, and results from a high-throughput mutagenesis analysis, we determined the RNA sequence and structural features governing the specificity of NSUN6-mediated mRNA methylation. Integrating these features into an NSUN6-RNA structural model, we identified an NSUN6 variant that largely loses tRNA methylation but retains mRNA methylation ability. Finally, we revealed a weak negative correlation between m5C methylation and translation efficiency. Our findings uncover that mRNA m5C is tightly controlled by an elaborate two-enzyme system, and the protein-RNA structure analysis strategy established may be applied to other RNA modification writers to distinguish the functions of different RNA substrates of a writer protein.},
